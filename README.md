# Stochastic-Imaging

Python v3.5

Producing, Analysing and Aggregating images

- This repository will follow my final year project, the aim being to beat optical resolution with stochastic imaging
- Initially it will include basic code, subsequent additions will be more complex and complete
- The end result will be a labelled project which will allow someone to set up their own version of the experiment and use the code in this repository to recreate it
